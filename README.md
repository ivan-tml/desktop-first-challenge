# Desktop First Challenge

As in the mobile-first approach, global styles goes on the top of the file. 
In this case, those styles are applied to the desktop and all the other devices if not specified 
with media queries otherwise later in the code. 
Unlike mobile-first media queries, desktop-first queries are applied decreasingly, 
from largest to the smallest screen size.
